jManage (deployed as a stand-alone war)
======
Traditionally [jmanage](http://jmanage.org/) has been deployed on a jManage server using Jetty as the container.

The branch where all of this work happened is named _jmanage-war_

This git repo has all of the history from the [svn repo](http://jmanage.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmanage/) imported inside it.
