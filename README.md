jManage (deployed as a stand-alone war)
======
Traditionally [jmanage](http://jmanage.org/) has been deployed on a jManage server using Jetty as the container. This project attempts to eliminate the dependence on Jetty and allows users with existing application servers to deploy jManage as a stand-alone war.

The branch where all of this work happened is named [jmanage-war](../../tree/jmanage-war)

This git repo has all of the history from the [svn repo](http://jmanage.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jmanage/) imported inside it.
