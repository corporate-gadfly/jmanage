      <title>jManage Overview</title>
      <p>
jManage is a web and command-line based JMX client, which provides a
centralized console for managing application clusters and distributed application
production environments.
<br/><br/>
We are currently developing version 0.5, which has the following features:
<br/><br/>
    - Web based interface, which allows jManage to be used from behind firewall
<br/>
    - Complete security - application server passwords are encrypted
<br/>
    - Command line interface
<br/>
    - Support for different J2EE app servers
<br/>
    - Authentication and Role Management
<br/>
    - Configuring Applications in jManage
<br/>
    - Runtime Graphing
<br/>
<br/><br/>
          jManage is being built keeping security in mind, as the main target
          usage of jManage is in the production environment. Production
          environments usually have limited access and are managed by an
          operations team. jManage lets the operations team to monitor the
          production environment (via browser or command line) and also
          allows the operations team to give controlled access to developers, QA
          and others. Operations team can create jManage users and assign
          roles to these users. Access to different features can be controlled
          by assigining permissions to various roles. Permission can be granted
          even at the level of MBean attributes or operations.
