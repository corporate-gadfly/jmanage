          jManage is typically deployed in a production environment in the
          same network as the applications to be managed. This allows jManage
          to access the JMX enabled applications via any JMX remoting protocol
          supported by that application. Users access jManage over HTTP via
          a web browser or command line.

          Access to jManage is controlled via username/password provided
          by the System Administrators or the Operations team. Admins can
          control access even at the MBean attribute or operation level.
          <br/><br/>
          User activites are logged in a log file, which can be audited
          by the System Administrators.
