1.  Install JDK_1.4.X.
2.  Set JAVA_HOME to JDK_1.4.X installation directory.
3.  Unzip jmanage-0.1.zip to an installation directory: <INSTALL_DIR>
    (E.g.: c:\jmanage OR /jmanage).
4.  Set JMANAGE_HOME to jManage installation directory.
5.  Copy weblogic.jar (from Weblogic 6.1 installation) to "<INSTALL_DIR>/ext"
    directory.
6.  Go to JManage installation directory and run "keygen". This prompts for a
    password which will be used to start the server. This password is also the
    "admin" user password. Password won't be displayed on the console while entering.
7.  By default, jManage starts on port 9090. If you want to change this, you
    need to set JMANAGE_PORT environment variable
8.  Run "startup" from the jManage installation directory and enter password
    configured in the previous step, which again won't be displayed. This starts
    the JManage server.
9.  Access the server with URL "http://<server name>:9090/".
10. Login to the application with username as "admin" and with configured password.
11. Now configure your applciations to manage/monitor through jManage.
